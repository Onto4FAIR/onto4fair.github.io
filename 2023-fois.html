    <h2 class="hidden">Introduction</h2>
   
    <p>Making the resources produced by researchers fully reusable and understood requires specific efforts. 
	    The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles were elaborated to address these issues, 
	    describing a set of requirements for resource reusability and interoperability. 
	    These principles have been gaining increasing attention in a range of different areas and applications. </>
    <p>One the one hand, a key aspect is the ability of properly and semantically describing resources, in particular with the help of ontologies. 
	    On the other hand, ontologies themselves have to be compliant with the FAIR principles.</p>
	      
	  
    <p>The workshop has the following goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to bring together leaders from academia, industry and user institutions to discuss the adoption of FAIR principles in research and real-world requirements</li>
      <li>to serve to inform about existing research efforts that may meet their requirements.</li>
      <li>to investigate how the FAIR principles are supported by the use of ontologies that ideally are themselves FAIR.</li>
      <li>to discuss the challenges and perspectives in adopting FAIR principles.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="topics">
	<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>

<p><i>16:00-16:10 Welcome from the organisers</i></p>

<p><i>16:10-16:50 Invited talk</i></p>
<p>A FAIR Catalog of Ontology-Driven Conceptual Models, Tiago Sales (Senior Researcher at the Semantics, Cybersecurity & Services Group of the University of Twente in The Netherlands)</p> 
<p>Abstract: Multi-domain model catalogs serve as empirical sources of knowledge and insights about specific domains, about the use of a modeling language’s constructs, 
	as well as about the patterns and anti-patterns recurrent in the models of that language crosscutting different domains. They may support domain and language learning, 
	model reuse, knowledge discovery for humans, and reliable automated processing and analysis if built following generally accepted quality requirements for scientific data management. 
	More specifically, not unlike scientific (meta)data, models should be shared according to the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability). 
	In this talk, we report on the construction of a FAIR model catalog for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling research, a trending paradigm lying at the intersection of conceptual modeling and ontology engineering in which the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and OntoUML emerged among the most adopted technologies. 
	The catalog, publicly available at https://w3id.org/ontouml-models/, currently includes over one hundred and forty models, developed in a variety of contexts and domains.</p>
