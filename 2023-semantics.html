  <section class="introduction" id="introduction">
    <h2 class="hidden">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Making the huge and diverse kinds of data produced by researchers, data stewards, and service providers, fully reusable and understood requires specific efforts. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) principles were elaborated to address these issues, describing a set of requirements for data reusability and interoperability. These principles have been gaining increasing attention in a range of different areas and applications, including in the industrial area.</p>
    <p>A key aspect in making data FAIR is the ability of machines to automatically find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention. For that, the ability of properly and semantically describing data is essential.</p>
    <p>The workshop has the following goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to bring together leaders from academia, industry and user institutions to discuss the adoption of FAIR principles in real-world requirements.</li>
      <li>to serve to inform industry and user representatives about existing research efforts that may meet their requirements. </li>
      <li>to investigate how the FAIR principles are supported by the use of schemes, vocabulaires, and ontologies that ideally are themselves FAIR.</li>
      <li>to discuss the challenges and perspectives in adopting FAIR principles.</li>
    </ul>
